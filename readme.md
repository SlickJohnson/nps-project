## Questions I have

- Which track had the most promoters/detractors?
- How many promoters think their track was too fast/too slow/just right?
- Which weeks had the most complaints about schedule pacing?
- Which locations had the most promoters/detractors?
- What year had the greater NPS score?
- How did the number of promoters change over the weeks?
- What is the probability that someone who complains about schedule pacing (too fast/too slow) was a detractor?

## Outline Steps

1. Clean 2017 dataset
2. Glob 2016 dataset
3. Clean globbed DataFrame
4. Combine both datasets into one DataFrame
